# Unity3D ECS Helpers!

This is a collection of some useful scripts while Unity DOTS is still in preview.

# CustomConvertToEntity
This is a customized version of Unitys ConvertToEntity which relies on reflection.
Add it to the GameObject you want to convert.
Instead of always using the default world, you can set a list of worldnames in which you want to convert your gameobject into an entity. (e.g. TestWorld or for the default world "Default World")
