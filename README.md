# Unity3D ECS Helpers!

This is a collection of some useful scripts while Unity DOTS is still in preview.

# CustomConvertToEntity
This is a customized version of Unitys ConvertToEntity which relies on reflection.
Add it to the GameObject you want to convert.
Instead of always using the default world, you can set the worldname of the world in which you want to convert your gameobject into an entity. (e.g. TestWorld or for the default world "Default World")
